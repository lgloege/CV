<h1 align='center'>a YAML CV</h1>
<h5 align='center'>Last updated: September 2018 </h5>

All CV data is stored in YAML. This makes the raw data easy to read, quick to change,
and compileable to any format.

+ ```cv-data.yml```  = cv in YAML format
+ ```cv-class.cls``` = cv class
+ ```cv-template.tex``` = cv latex template
+ ```cv-publications.bib``` = bib file for publications
+ ```cv.tex``` = compiled latex file
+ ```cv.pdf``` = pdf compiled used pdflatex
+ ```makefile``` = makefile to do all the compiling

#### Notes
-  if you include a ":" you need to escapte that character 

#### When and if I have time...
I would like this to compile to HTML. But I need a nice format and a reason to do so.
PDF is so much more portable.
